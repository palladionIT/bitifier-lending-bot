# Bitifier

## Description
A Bitcoin bot written in Python to do margin funding on Bitfinex and (once I rewrote the trading part) trades on kraken. Although there exist other bots that do the same this is one has fairly minimal requirements.
This is a side project and I am no software developer so use with caution. I work on it while I can but can not make any guarantees that it will work and perform up to ones expectations. I have used it for a year know and it served its purpose very well - apart from the trading part.
So for your own sake try to understand the code. I will work on the documentation as well in the near future.

The project was based on [MarginBot](https://github.com/HFenter/MarginBot) and follows roughly its lending strategy. However it has been adapted through the configuration and can be adapted through there. Another similar project is [Crypto Coin Lending Bot](https://github.com/BitBotFactory/poloniexlendingbot) with more features and a nice web interface. However it also has more dependencies and is less minimal(read "crude") than this one.

## Features

- Bitfinex Bitcoin lending
- Bitfinex USD lending
- *very* crude RSI based Kraken trading (currently working on better method)

## Dependencies

Python packages
Python 3.5 (might work on others but untested)
krakenex
Peewee (with SQLCipher playhouse extension)

## Running

Run with the following Python 3.5 command

> python3.5 __init__.py -a 'bitfinex,kraken' -f

For trying the very bad Kraken trading capabilities add '-t' to the bot.

On the first run it will ask you for your account details and API information. The information will be saved in an SQLCipher database so the information should be protected.

## Todo

- [ ] create virtualenv && requirements.txt
- [ ] clean code
- [ ] rewrite API
  - [x] rewrite BFXAPI
  - [x] implement kraken API
- [ ] implement scheduler
  - [x] implement funding module
    - [ ] move account code to module code
    - [ ] adapt to new API architecture
  - [ ] implement trading module
    - [x] implement statistics polling
    - [x] implement statistics analysis
    - [ ] implement in-memory data pruning
    - [ ] implement trading based on statistics

## Disclaimer

This work is very raw, under development and there is a ton of dead code in there. I will eventually work on all these issues however I don'have the necessary time to put more effort in to it right now.
Updates follow as my work/life balance permits.
